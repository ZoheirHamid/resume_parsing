    "- Define constants\n",
    "- Measure your computer's resource use\n",
    "- Use pandas to read in a .csv file, learn information about the data in the file, summarize the data, replace messy values, convert data types from text to numeric, and do simple plotting.\n",

The [pandas website](https://www.example.com) describes the project's goal - pandas \"aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real world data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has the broader goal of becoming the most powerful and flexible open source data analysis / manipulation tool available in any language.\"\n",

    "Above, we also defined a \"constant\" - though Python doesn't support constants in a technical sense, you can use all capital letters to make it clear to other developers that you're treating the variable as a constant.

This is a common data format that uses a comma between the value in each column of data (\"comma delimited\") and it usually puts quotation marks around any data that inherently has commas (in case one of your columns itself needs commas).\n",
